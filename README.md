## Notes

One of the main challenges I faced was my limited experience with JavaScript. I had to learn and troubleshoot along the way, but I gradually got the hang of it. CSS was also a consistent challenge, particularly understanding which elements to target and how to apply the right styles to achieve the layout I envisioned.
